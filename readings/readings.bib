	abstract = {The concept of the molten salt reactor ({MSR)} refuses to go away. The Generation-{IV} process lists the {MSR} as one of the six concepts to be considered for extending fuel resources. Good fuel utilization and good economics are required to meet the often-cited goal of 10 {TWe} globally and 1 {TWe} for the {US} by non-carbon energy sources in this century by nuclear fission. Strong incentives for the molten salt reactor design are its good fuel utilization, good economics, amazing fuel flexibility and promised large benefits. It can:• use thorium or uranium; • be designed with lots of graphite to have a fairly thermal neutron spectrum or without graphite moderator to have an epithermal neutron spectrum; • fission uranium isotopes and plutonium isotopes; • produces less long-lived wastes than today’s reactors by a factor of 10–100; • operate with non-weapon grade fissile fuel, or in suitable sites it can operate with enrichment between reactor-grade and weapon grade fissile fuel; • be a breeder or near breeder; • operate at temperature \&gt;1100 {°C} if carbon composites are successfully developed. Enhancing {232U} content in the uranium to over 500 ppm makes the fuel undesirable for weapons, but it should not detract from its economic use in liquid fuel reactors: a big advantage in nonproliferation. Economics of the {MSR} are enhanced by operating at low pressure and high temperature and may even lead to the preferred route to hydrogen production. The cost of the electricity produced from low enriched fuel averaged over the life of the entire process, has been predicted to be about 10\% lower than that from {LWRs}, and 20\% lower for high-enriched fuel, with uncertainties of about 10\%. The development cost has been estimated at about 1 B\$ (e.g., a 100 M\$/year base program for 10 years) not including construction of a series of reactors leading up to the deployment of multiple commercial units at an assumed cost of 9 B\$ (450 M\$/year over 20 years). A benefit of liquid fuel is that smaller power reactors can faithfully test features of larger reactors, thereby reducing the number of steps to commercial deployment. Assuming electricity is worth \$ 50 per {MWe} h, then 50 years of 10 {TWe} power level would be worth 200 trillion dollars. If the {MSR} could be developed and proven for 10 B\$ and would save 10\% over its alternative, the total savings over 50 years would be 20 trillion dollars: a good return on investment even considering discounted future savings. The incentives for the molten salt reactor are so strong and its relevance to our energy policy and national security are so compelling that one asks, {“Why} has the reactor not already been developed?”},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor ({MSR)}, which is one of the {‘Generation} {IV’} concepts, can be used for transmutation, and production of electricity, hydrogen and fissile fuels. In this study, a single-liquid-fueled {MSR} is designed for conceptual research, in which no solid material is present in the core as moderator, except for the external reflector. The fuel salt flow makes the {MSR} neutronics different from that of conventional reactors using solid fuels, and couples the flow and heat transfer strongly. Therefore, it is necessary to study the core characteristics with due attention to the coupling among flow, heat transfer and neutronics. The standard turbulent model is adopted to establish the flow and heat transfer model, while the diffusion theory is used for the neutronics model, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for fast and thermal neutron fluxes, and balance equations for six groups of delayed neutron precursors. These two models which are coupled through the temperature and heat source are coded in a microcomputer program. The distributions of the velocity, temperature, neutron fluxes, and delayed neutron precursors under the rated condition are obtained. In addition, the effects of the inflow temperature, inflow velocity, and the fuel salt residence time out of the core are discussed in detail. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of the new generation molten salt reactors.},

The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories ({ORNL)} and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR)} program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where {ORNL} left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, {MSBR} design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that {ORNL} proposed for the majority of its {MSR} program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile {233UF4} and fertile {ThF4.} Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by {ORNL} was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than {LWR} or {CANDU} without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

This chapter is devoted to the fuels and coolants of the molten salt reactor ({MSR)}, which belongs to one of the six nuclear reactor concepts considered in the Generation {IV} initiative. The chapter is divided into ten different sections and starts with an introduction (Section 3.13.1), in which the general characteristics of the {MSR} are described. This is followed by a report (Section 3.13.2) on the historical developments of this reactor concept, with the main emphasis on the work performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s and 1970s. Section 3.13.3 briefly explains the current {MSR} concepts and their applications as either breeder designs or actinide burner concepts in the management of the long-lived actinides. Section 3.13.4 summarizes the physicochemical properties of typical fuels and coolants, based on the critical evaluation of available experimental data of the fluoride systems. This section is divided into several subsections based on the properties discussed, giving first a brief description of the structure of the fluoride liquids, followed by the description of various phase diagrams. Furthermore, the solubility of actinide fluorides in the fuel matrix is given, as well as information about the density, viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and the vapor pressure. One of the key issues is the understanding of the fuel behavior under irradiating conditions. This is briefly discussed in Section 3.13.7. Section 3.13.8 is related to the fission products and their behavior in the fluoride fuel matrix with respect to their solubility, and Section 3.13.9 addresses the corrosion effects of the fuel salt on the structural materials.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling ({MPM)} approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR)}, which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation {IV} International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical {MSR} core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, {Navier–Stokes} equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the {RANS} (Reynolds Averaged {Navier–Stokes)} scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code {NEWT} of {SCALE} 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed {MPM} approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by {COMSOL} Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the {MSRs.}},

	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR)} technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors ({FR)} with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The {MSFR} emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the {MSFR.} Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The {MSFR} also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The {MSFR} inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional {FRs}, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the {MSFR} presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the {MSFR} allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the {MSFR} out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current {MSFR} conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the {MSFR} promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

For the purpose of validation, the results of the {MSR} Experiment ({MSRE)} natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the {MSRE} and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the {MSRE}, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
The fluoride salt cooled high temperature reactor ({FHR)} is a class of fission reactor designs that use liquid fluoride salt coolant, {TRISO} coated particle fuel, and graphite moderator. Heavy ion fusion ({HIF)} can likewise make use of liquid fluoride salts, to create thick or thin liquid layers to protect structures in the target chamber from ablation by target X-rays and damage from fusion neutron irradiation. This presentation summarizes ongoing work in support of design development and safety analysis of {FHR} systems. Development work for fluoride salt systems with application to both {FHR} and {HIF} includes thermal-hydraulic modeling and experimentation, salt chemistry control, tritium management, salt corrosion of metallic alloys, and development of major components (e.g., pumps, heat exchangers) and gas-Brayton cycle power conversion systems. In support of {FHR} development, a thermal-hydraulic experimental test bay for separate effects ({SETs)} and integral effect tests ({IETs)} was built at {UC} Berkeley, and a second {IET} facility is under design. The experiments investigate heat transfer and fluid dynamics and they make use of oils as simulant fluids at reduced scale, temperature, and power of the prototypical salt-cooled system. With direct application to {HIF}, vortex tube flow was investigated in scaled experiments with mineral oil. Liquid jets response to impulse loading was likewise studied using water as a simulant fluid. A set of four workshops engaging industry and national laboratory experts were completed in 2012, with the goal of developing a technology pathway to the design and licensing of a commercial {FHR.} The pathway will include experimental and modeling efforts at universities and national laboratories, requirements for a component test facility for reliability testing of fluoride salt equipment at prototypical conditions, requirements for an {FHR} test reactor, and development of a pre-conceptual design for a commercial reactor.},

	abstract = {The one-group diffusion theory of molten salt reactors in a homogeneous reactor model is revisited. First, the integral terms in the equation for the flux, obtained after the elimination of the delayed neutron precursors, are given a physical interpretation. This gives an understanding of the physical meaning of the concept of infinite fuel recirculation velocity, which eliminates one of the two integral terms, introduced in earlier work in order to find analytic solutions. In the light of the physical interpretation, another approximation, representing a different limiting case can be defined, corresponding to long recirculation times, i.e. no recirculation of the delayed neutron precursors to the core. This approximation incurs the neglecting of the other integral term, and it can also be solved analytically. Finally it is shown that the full equation, without neglecting any of the integral terms, has also a compact analytical solution and it is demonstrated how the case of the infinite velocity can be obtained as a limit case of the full solution. The analytical solutions open up the possibility to study a number of questions in analytical form, such as the calculation of the point kinetic response of the reactor, or the effect of the different boundary conditions. As an illustration, the solutions corresponding to the vanishing of the flux at the extrapolated boundary are compared to those obtained from the logarithmic boundary conditions.},
